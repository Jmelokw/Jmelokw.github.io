		Funny Sports Poem:
		<br>
	</h1>
	<h4>
		I just got back from a pizza party with Skateboarding. Can you believe we got to eat Curling pizza in Badminton?! Everyone got to choose their own toppings. I made 'Rugby and Ice Hockey' pizza, which is my favorite! They even stuffed the crust with Boxing. How Soccer! If that wasn't good enough already, Baseball was there singing Basketball. I was so inspired by the music, I had to get up out of my seat and Gymnastics.

	Olympic Poem:
	<br>
</h1>
<h4>
	Only for those of a special breed,
Living a dream, a chance to succeed,
Yesterday's hopes and desires coming true,
Making your mark with records anew
Proving hard work and the daily grind,
Instructing the body, conditioning the mind
Can capture a medal for the whole world to see, with
Glamour and Pride for your country,
As you stand aloft and you flag is flown high, there's
Memories forever, and a tear in your eye,
Enjoying the moment, the admiring looks,
Securing you name in the history books.
