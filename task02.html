		Funny Sports Poem:
		<br>
	</h1>
	<pre>
I just got back from a pizza party with Skateboarding. 
Can you believe we got to eat Curling pizza in Badminton?! 
Everyone got to choose their own sports toppings. 
I made 'Rugby and Ice Hockey' pizza, which is my favorite! 
They even stuffed the crust with Boxing, how soccer!
And if that wasn't good enough already, Baseball was there singing Basketball!
I was so inspired by the music, I had to get up out of my seat and Gymnastics.

	Olympic Poem:
	<br>
</h1>
<pre>
Only for those of a special breed,
Living a dream, a chance to succeed,
Yesterday's hopes and desires coming true,
Making your mark with records anew
Proving hard work and the daily grind,
Instructing the body, conditioning the mind
Can capture a medal for the whole world to see, with
Glamour and Pride for your country,
As you stand aloft and you flag is flown high, there's
Memories forever, and a tear in your eye,
Enjoying the moment, the admiring looks,
Securing you name in the history books.
