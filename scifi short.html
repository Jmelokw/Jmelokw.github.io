		<h1>Short Sci-Fi Story :)</h1>
		<h2>His vision blurred. Around him, everything seemed to be a whir. He had been in front of his computer seconds ago. Then he had been... Sucked in through the screen. A vortex. He was falling.
<br>Falling.
<br>"Argh!" He cried out, his legs gave out beneath him, causing him to collapse onto the scalding hot ground.
<br>His eyes widened as he saw the mark on the ground. The symbol. He had seen it before. WHERE, though?
<br>His blood coursed through his veins, hotter and hotter. His pupils dilated and slowly changed from that cool grey, to that bright red. He stretched his hand and cracked his knuckles. Such a satisfying sound. He let out a soft moan as he watched his hand turn into cool, hard metal. He was one of them now. 
<br>All he'd done was look at the mark... Then he realised.
<br>The symbol. It had changed him into this... Bot.</h2>
